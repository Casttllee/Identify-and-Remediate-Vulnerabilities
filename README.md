# Identify-and-Remediate-Vulnerabilities

## Objective

Utilize Metasploitable2 and OpenVAS to identify and remediate vulnerabilities in a simulated network environment. This involves scanning for vulnerabilities, analyzing the results, and applying appropriate remediation techniques to secure the system. The goal is to enhance skills in vulnerability assessment, exploit identification, and system hardening.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
